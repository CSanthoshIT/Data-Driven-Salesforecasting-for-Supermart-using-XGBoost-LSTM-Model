# ðŸ›’ Data-Driven Sales Forecasting for Supermart using XGBoost & LSTM Model

This project aims to forecast Supermart's sales using a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of **XGBoost** (for feature-based modeling) and **LSTM** (for sequence learning). The predictive system is designed to help in inventory planning, marketing decisions, and demand forecasting.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Sales forecasting is critical for supply chain efficiency and profitability. This project leverages both **traditional machine learning** and **deep learning** techniques:

- **XGBoost** is used for feature-based learning (e.g., holidays, store type, promotions).
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks capture temporal dependencies and trends in sales data.
- Built using **Python** and developed in **PyCharm IDE**.

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

### 1. XGBoost
- Gradient boosting algorithm to predict near-term sales using engineered features.
- Handles categorical and missing data well.
- Used for modeling tabular, non-sequential aspects of the dataset.

### 2. LSTM
- Recurrent neural network tailored for time series forecasting.
- Captures temporal patterns in the sales data.
- Used for learning long-term trends and seasonality.

### 3. Hybrid Ensemble (Optional)
- Combines both model predictions (e.g., averaging or weighted blending) to improve forecast accuracy.
